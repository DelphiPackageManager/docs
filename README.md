# DPM Documentation

DPM's documentation is built using [vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/)

We welcome contributions, if you would like to help, create an issue first so we can make sure we are on the same page, then fork the repo, make the change and then submit a pull request.

We recommend using vscode to edit the documentation.

This repo is setup with github actions to build and deploy automatically - so once pull requests are merged the changes will show up on the [documentation site](https://docs.delphi.dev) in a few minutes.
